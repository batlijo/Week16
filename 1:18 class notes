unit testing:
- test function by function
  - you test a single unit
  - functional test, tests all the variables together

nightmare.js: behavior driven testing...mimicking the browser

-user stories are used in project management

  WHAT ARE USER STORIES ??? what does the code look like

  nightmare is to generate browser and you can use it in conjunction with mocha for unit testing

  require("chai") = THIS IS TO USE MOCHA

  so tests will show you what an app would look like and if there are errors it will tell you in english what is wrong and what it's supposed to do.
